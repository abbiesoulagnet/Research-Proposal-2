     <h1>What do the experts have to say about this?</h1>
     <h2>Literature Review</h2>
         <font size="+2">
     <p>According to the article “Effects of a community-based sex education and reproductive health service program on contraceptive use of unmarried youths in Shanghai” by Dr. Chao-Hua Lou’s team of doctors, “unmarried individuals in Shanghai were almost 15 times more likely to invest in effective contraceptive practices than they were at the beginning of the teaching and counseling health sessions”. Assuming that the benefits of contraception are a given, we know that birth control is necessary for sexually active individuals who do not desire children. However, how many of these methods are dangerous? How much of that information is disclosed to the people seeking it, and how much of it is catered to women, only half of the participating parties? Are there better methods of birth control in the making?
To answer this in part, “The difficulties and dangers of oral contraception” by Wilfred G Mills articulated that “there are several immediate complications that may endanger life”, along with many other side effects that are undesirable to say the least. An estimated 4-10% of women on this form of BC will develop at least one of these symptoms. With “the pill” being the most popular form of female birth control, that comes out to be a LOT of negatively affected people.
I hope to add to this conversation by proposing alternate forms of contraception for men, and stressing the importance of including these options, as well as full birth control disclosure, in relevant health discussions and courses.
