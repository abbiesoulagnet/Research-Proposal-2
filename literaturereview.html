     What do the experts have to say about this?</h1>
     <h2>Literature Review</h2>
         <font size="+2">
     <p>Many studies have been conducted to prove the effectiveness of comprehensive health courses. For example, according to the article “Effects of a community-based sex education and reproductive health service program on contraceptive use of unmarried youths in Shanghai” by Dr. Chao-Hua Lou’s team of doctors, “unmarried individuals in Shanghai were almost 15 times more likely to invest in effective contraceptive practices than they were at the beginning of the teaching and counseling health sessions”. Assuming that the benefits of contraception are a given, we know that birth control is necessary for sexually active individuals who do not desire children.

        <p>From studies like these, we how beneficial sex education can be. But could we be doing it better? Are there aspects of it that are driving people away from reproductive health care? Comprehensive sex-ed is still a fairly new concept, and just as abstinence-only teaching had its flaws, this will too. 
           </p>
           <br>
           <p>American health courses, even those practicing comprehensive sex-education, are often plagued with hints of sexist, misogynistic and even racist ideologies. For example, while it is common to practice saying “no” to a partner in health class (stemming once again from purity culture and abstinence training), it is not common to practice conversations about boundaries when both parties decide they are interested in sex. Health courses tend to focus on heterosexual couples, often making for a non-inclusive environment for queer individuals to ask questions. Diagrams and texbooks on sexual health have almost exclusively featured white people until recently, and almost never discuss how minorities and low income communities are more catastrophically impacted by teen pregnancy and STD transmittance than others. Also rare is experiencing class discussions about difficult topics in reproductive medicine, such as how to proceed if things like birth control side effects, STD transmittance, HIV transmittance, unwanted pregnancy, sexual assault or rape directly affect you. Comprehensive methods cannot stop at teaching anatomy. There are heavy psychological and communicative aspects to intimacy that shouldn’t be overlooked. 
           </p>
           <br>
           <p>Many of these issues have already been explored by researchers.</p>
           <br>
           <p>Courtney Shah, an Oxford student, writes: “In the 1980s and 1990s, the political power of the evangelical movement in the United States attracted support for “abstinence-only” curricula that relied on scare tactics and traditional assumptions about gender and sexuality. The ever-expanding acceptance (both legal and social) of lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender identity directly challenged the conservative turn of abstinence-until-marriage sex education programs. The politics of gender, race, class, and sexual orientation have consistently shaped and limited sex education.” These ideas still affect the learning environment now.
           </p>
           <br>
           <p>“The difficulties and dangers of oral contraception” by Wilfred G Mills articulated that “there are several immediate complications that may endanger life”, along with many other side effects that are undesirable to say the least. An estimated 4-10% of women on this form of BC will develop at least one of these symptoms. With “the pill” being the most popular form of female birth control, that’s up to an estimated 10 million people experiencing harmful symptoms in 2022. Many of these individuals shy away from birth control, especially hormonal kinds, for fear of the same symptoms occurring in their next option. Now, this is not to say that they are giving up birth control completely. Many people will choose to fall back on condoms. And while this is better than nothing, it is less effective at preventing pregnancy than other forms of BC. A female condom is only 79% effective, and a male condom is 87% effective. Compared to methods like the IUD (99.8% effective), there is a lot of room for error. Side effects would not be so frightening if individuals were fully informed of the possibilities in this area. Not one contraceptive method works for everyone, and sometimes, experimentation is necessary before finding something that is satisfactory for the patient.
For women in heterosexual relationships whose bodies are less suited for extra hormones, whose mood, weight, skin, libido, etc. are consistently negatively affected by it, it may be in the couples’ best interest to consider male birth control. Hormonal contraceptives for men are quite underdeveloped, but not nonexistent!

           <p>Dr. Tolulope Bakare, director of male reproductive health at UTSouthwestern, outlines the newest adaptations in studies on DMAU, a male birth control pill that limits FSH and LH without lowering testosterone levels. Dr. Bakare notes that it could be commercially available within about seven years from now.
           </p>
           <br>
           <p>Having seen what kinds of topics should probably be included in health curriculums, the next step is to find out how common young adults felt ill prepared taking care of their own reproductive health, how much of it could be prevented in the classroom, and propose new ideas or practices that coils be used by health educators.
