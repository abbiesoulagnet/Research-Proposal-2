    <h1>Why Does Sex-Positive Sex Education Matter?</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <font size="+2">
    <p>I want to find information about the consequences of poor sex education as well as the side effects of certain contraceptive methods. This is important because I do not want anyone making uninformed decisions about birth control or related issues, as the reproductive system is one of the most overlooked systems in education and medicine, especially regarding women. I want to call attention to the frequent and harmful simplification of birth control risks, as well as the lack of contraception made for men. As a woman from a small town, I have witnessed the negative implications of poor sex education, abstinence focused health classes, birth control misinformation and the misogyny that comes with conversations about the reproductive system. As a future OB-GYN, I hope to destigmatize topics surrounding reproductive health, encourage new ideas regarding contraception, and provide as many people as possible with the tools and resources they need to make informed decisions about all aspects of their health. 

I think that if full disclosure is given about the possibilities and risks of contraceptive methods in sex education, less individuals will encounter undesirable side effects and health risks from contraception. 

If this is true, more individuals may be inclined to seek out contraception, including men. Partners who are both on birth control will have minute chances of unwanted pregnancies.
If this is untrue, there may be more people trying new BC methods that also have side effects.

     <h1>What do the experts have to say about this?</h1>
     <h2>Literature Review</h2>
     <p>According to the article “Effects of a community-based sex education and reproductive health service program on contraceptive use of unmarried youths in Shanghai” by Dr. Chao-Hua Lou’s team of doctors, “unmarried individuals in Shanghai were almost 15 times more likely to invest in effective contraceptive practices than they were at the beginning of the teaching and counseling health sessions”. Assuming that the benefits of contraception are a given, we know that birth control is necessary for sexually active individuals who do not desire children. However, how many of these methods are dangerous? How much of that information is disclosed to the people seeking it, and how much of it is catered to women, only half of the participating parties? Are there better methods of birth control in the making?
To answer this in part, “The difficulties and dangers of oral contraception” by Wilfred G Mills articulated that “there are several immediate complications that may endanger life”, along with many other side effects that are undesirable to say the least. An estimated 4-10% of women on this form of BC will develop at least one of these symptoms. With “the pill” being the most popular form of female birth control, that comes out to be a LOT of negatively affected people.
I hope to add to this conversation by proposing alternate forms of contraception for men, and stressing the importance of including these options, as well as full birth control disclosure, in relevant health discussions and courses.
