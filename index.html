How can we refine comprehensive sex-education courses and combat the consequences of years of abstienence-only health courses in America?
</h1>
     <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <font size="+2">
     <p>Abstinence-based sex education has a long winded history of supplying young adults with very little or very poor training surrounding their own bodies and how they interact with one another. The fact of the matter is, sex is going to happen! It is a completely natural part of growing up, and the demonization of it stemming from purity culture could very well be to blame for high amounts of STDs in certain communities, heightened abortion rates, unwanted pregnancies, birth control dissatisfaction and more. This study would be conducted to find firsthand information about the consequences of poor sex education as well as the side effects of certain contraceptive methods which abstinence based courses tend to gloss over frequently. This is important because individual lives can be severely negatively affected from making uninformed decisions about birth control or related issues, as the reproductive system is one of the most overlooked systems in education and medicine, especially regarding women. It is imperative that we call attention to the frequent and harmful simplification of birth control risks, as well as newer topics in the reproductive world like the lack of contraception made for men. As a woman from a small town, I have witnessed the negative implications of poor sex education, abstinence focused health classes, birth control misinformation and the misogyny that comes with conversations about the reproductive system. As a future OB-GYN, I hope to destigmatize topics surrounding reproductive health, encourage new ideas regarding contraception, and provide as many people as possible with the tools and resources they need to make informed decisions about all aspects of their health.

     <br>
     <p>I believe that if full disclosure was given about reproductive topics including the possibilities and risks of contraceptive methods in sex education, societal benefits would skyrocket. More specifically, pinpointing the failing teaching methods behind grievances with contraception could be a step in the right direction as far as altering the reproductive educational standards, thus lowering STD transmission rates, abortion rates, unwanted pregnancies, and misinformation about personal autonomy. 
     </p>
     <br>
     <p>At this point in medical research, it is understood that abstinence-only teaching in health courses does not lower teen pregnancy, STD transmission, etc. However, I hope to contribute to this conversation by isolating the parts of comprehensive sex education that could be used to lower these occurrances.
