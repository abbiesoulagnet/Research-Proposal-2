     How can we make this possible?</h1>

       <h2>Methods</h2>
         <font size="+2">
     <p>For this research project, I would use the survey method for the main statistics. Because this topic is relevant to medicine, I would also include a couple of particularly impactful interviews or personal stories from hospital patients who have been largely affected by topics discussed on this site. I believe that having numbers in this case would be particularly beneficial because it would provide a general consensus of the part of the American school system in question. The interviews would help to engage readers with the content. Oftentimes, topics regarding intimacy and personal health can draw out unique stories that draw people in. If someone had had a negative experience with birth control, had gone through with a teen pregnancy, or had made a regrettable healthcare decision, it could very well be drawn back to their sex education. On the other hand, if someone had prevented an undesirable circumstance due to good sex education, that is also something that I woud like to document.

           <h2>Survey Group</h2>
               <font size="+2">
           <p>I would like to survey individuals who have taken part in American health courses and witnessed their teaching methods first hand, and see how that has translated to their personal knowledge of sex education and contraception. I would like to interview a couple of individuals with extraordinary stories relating to these topics, such as teen parents, those with negatively or positively impacted health from birth control, or possibly physicians or nurses who have heard plenty of these stories. I would focus on subjects from ages 18-25 because this age group is most likely to be involved in a school health course, or have taken one recently, and may be sexually active. I will not be asking personal questions regarding such private activities, but recognize that discussing birth control, mentions of intimate partnerships may arise and I will only be documenting those answers from age appropriate individuals. It is also helpful for me as the researcher because I am most likely to encounter people within this age range at Portland State, so conducting surveys and interviews will be easier.

           <h2>Measurements and Data Collection Methods</h2>
               <font size="+2">
           <p>Variations in my survey design will be put in place to achieve total honesty from participants. I will ask multiple variants of the same questions and average the answers from the synonym polls for a thorough understanding of the concept. Someone may answer differently to “How applicable has this course been to your life?” than “Do you feel that you have been able to use the knowledge from this course in the real world?” These questions may be formatted differently in the reported research, and will address things like equity, inclusion, personal BC methods, observed curriculums and other related topics. I would like the participants to be able to answer the questions on a sliding scale so that numerical conclusions and averages can be achieved. Some questions will focus on the overall functionality of the course, while others will try to pinpoint the content of the courses they took and the reasons why they feel the way they do. If the average numbers agreed that the health courses did not prepare the subjects in this study for real life, my hypothesis would be supported and I would be able to put together a comprehensive list of helpful subjects for educators to include in their curriculums. It would be supported further if I found evidence that these ineffective courses focused on abstinence training, or spent little to no time on contraceptive education. My survey will account for differences in the individuals’ health courses such as year taken and state taken. There may be correlation between the health courses in more conservative states as opposed to more progressive ones.

           <h2>Procedure and Schedule</h2>
               <font size="+2">
           <p>I will present the stimuli over social media. Taking my survey to the internet could be very helpful for collecting participant data over a wide geographical range. The link to the survey will be available through a link in my Instagram biography. Participants will be able to access it for a week, and I will be able to view results from my end. They will be asked for their names, ages, the year of their latest health or sex-ed course, and then will be able to answer the general questions on the sliding scale. I am anticipating that there will be about 15-30 questions since some of them will be synonym-repeats. The quiz should not take more than 10 minutes for each individual to complete. The step by step on my side will be to:
           </center>
           <ol>
             <li>Create my survey as a google survey
               <li>Post the survey link on my Instagram page
                 <li>Advertise the survey on my Instagram story each day for a week
                   <li>Collect the results and calculate the averages of synonym questions
                     <li>Apply the results to my research paper
           </ol>
           <center>
           <p>Any participants under the age of 18 or over the age of 25 will be voided from the study. (I can request a specific age group on Instagram but have no way of actually preventing others from taking it, so they will have to be excluded manually.</p>
