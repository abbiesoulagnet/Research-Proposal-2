     <h1>How can we make this possible?</h1>
     <h2>Methods</h2>
         <font size="+2">
     <p>Methods
For this research project, I would use the survey method for the main statistics. Because this topic is concerning medicine, I would also include a couple of particularly impactful interviews or personal stories. I believe that having numbers in this case would be particularly beneficial because it would provide a general consensus of the part of the American school system in question. The interviews would help to engage readers with the content. Oftentimes, topics regarding intimacy and personal health can draw out unique stories that draw people in. If someone had had a negative experience with birth control, had gone through with a teen pregnancy, or had made a regrettable healthcare decision, it could very well be drawn back to their sex education. On the other hand, if someone had prevented an undesirable circumstance due to good sex education, that is also something that I woud like to document. I would like to survey individuals who have taken part in American health courses and witnessed their teaching methods first hand, and see how that has translated to their personal knowledge of sex education and contraception. I would like to interview a couple of individuals with extraordinary stories relating to these topics, such as teen parents, those with negatively or positively impacted health from birth control, or possibly physicians or nurses who have heard plenty of these stories. I would focus on subjects from ages 18-25 because this age group is most likely to be involved in a school health course, or have taken one recently, and may be sexually active. I will not be asking personal questions regarding such private activities, but recognize that discussing birth control, mentions of intimate partnerships may arise and I will only be documenting those answers from age appropriate individuals. It is also helpful for me as the researcher because I am most likely to encounter people within this age range at Portland State, so conducting surveys and interviews will be easier.
Design
Variations in my survey design will be put in place to achieve total honesty from participants. I will ask multiple variants of the same questions and average the answers from the synonym polls for a thorough understanding of the concept. Someone may answer differently to “How applicable has this course been to your life?” than “Do you feel that you have been able to use the knowledge from this course in the real world?” These questions may be formatted differently in the reported research. I would like the participants to be able to answer the questions on a sliding scale so that numerical conclusions can be achieved. Some questions will focus on the overall functionality of the course, while others will try to pinpoint the content of the courses they took and the reasons why they feel the way they do. If the average numbers agreed that the health courses did not prepare the subjects in this study for real life, my hypothesis would be supported. It would be supported further if I found evidence that these ineffective courses focused on abstinence training, or spent little to no time on contraceptive education. My survey will account for differences in the individuals’ health courses such as year taken and state taken. There may be correlation between the health courses in more conservative states as opposed to more progressive ones.
Procedure
I will present the stimuli over social media. Taking my survey to the internet could be very helpful for collecting participant data over a wide geographical range. The link to the survey will be available through a link in my Instagram biography. Participants will be able to access it for a week, and I will be able to view results from my end. They will be asked for their names, ages, the year of their latest health or sex-ed course, and then will be able to answer the general questions on the sliding scale. I am anticipating that there will be about 15-30 questions since some of them will be synonym-repeats. The quiz should not take more than 10 minutes for each individual to complete. The step by step on my side will be to:
Create my survey as a google survey
Post the survey link on my Instagram page
Advertise the survey on my Instagram stories each day for a week
Collect results and find the averages of synonym questions
Apply results to my research paper
Any participants under the age of 18 or over the age of 25 will be voided from the study. (I can request a specific age group on Instagram but have no way of actually preventing others from taking it, so they will have to be excluded manually.
Analysis
I will analyze my results by compiling all answers to the questions on a data table and finding the averages. I will also be able to document my sample size, which I will need for averages. (I will treat synonym questions as one, add up all of the answers, and divide by the amount of participants times the amount of synonym questions. Because people will be instructed to choose a number from 1-10 based on the accuracy of a statement I give them or a question I am asking, average numbers over 5 will be considered accurate to the statement. Answers under 5 will state that a statement is untrue. Questions will be considered separately, as they will all have their own conclusions. There will be a segment at the end of the survey for participants to tell me any specific memories they associate with health class to let them tell me things that my survey didn’t ask. They will all be informed that their answers may be used in my research paper. Results that agree with statements speaking negatively about abstinence teaching, contraception non disclosure, or religious inclusion in American health classes will confirm my hypothesis. The opposite is true for disconfirming it.
