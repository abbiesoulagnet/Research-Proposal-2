     <h1>So now what?</h1>
     <h2>Analysis</h2>
         <font size="+2">
     <p>I will conduct a numerical analysis of the survey results once the one week period is complete. All of these numbers will likely have different interpretations. It will be my job to analyze them accordingly and assign written value to each of the responses. The results of this experiment will be both qualitative and quantitative. The combined approach will have the benefit of strength in numbers as well as personal touches from interviews and written pieces from survey participants. I intend to obtain precise examples of the things that most negatively and most positively affected my subjectsâ€™ personal lives so that I can design a comprehensive course curriculum either for administrators to work into the education system or for guest presenters to address in a classroom setting. Statistical procedures will be used to find averages of synonym questions but the significance of these results will likely be insignificant without personal explanation and interpretation.
